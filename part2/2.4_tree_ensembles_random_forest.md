# 2.4. Tree Ensembles: Random Forest

Random Forest is a powerful and widely used ensemble learning method. To understand it, we must first understand its building block: the Decision Tree.

## 1. Decision Trees

A Decision Tree is a simple, flowchart-like model that makes predictions based on a series of feature-based splits.

*   **Structure:** It consists of a root node, internal nodes (which represent a test on a feature), and leaf nodes (which represent a class label or a continuous value).
*   **How it works:** Starting from the root, the tree recursively splits the data on the feature that results in the "best" separation of the data into distinct classes.
*   **Splitting Criteria:** The "best" split is typically determined by metrics that measure the purity of the resulting nodes, such as **Gini Impurity** or **Information Gain (Entropy)**.

### Pros & Cons of a Single Decision Tree:
*   **Pros:** Highly interpretable and easy to visualize.
*   **Cons:** Very prone to overfitting (it can learn the training data perfectly but fail to generalize). They are also unstable, meaning small variations in the data can result in a completely different tree.

## 2. Ensemble Learning: The Power of Many

Ensemble learning is the process of combining multiple machine learning models to create a more powerful model. The core idea is that the wisdom of the crowd is better than the wisdom of an individual. Random Forest is a type of ensemble model that uses a technique called **Bagging**.

## 3. Random Forest

A Random Forest is an ensemble of many Decision Trees. It mitigates the overfitting problem of single decision trees by introducing randomness and averaging the results.

### How It Works: The Two Sources of Randomness

1.  **Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging):**
    *   The algorithm creates numerous random subsets of the original training data *with replacement*. This means some data points may appear multiple times in a subset, while others may not appear at all.
    *   A separate Decision Tree is trained on each of these bootstrap samples.

2.  **Feature Randomness:**
    *   When building each tree, at every split point, the algorithm does not consider all available features.
    *   Instead, it selects a **random subset of features** and only considers these for the split. This is a key step that **decorrelates the trees**. If one feature is very predictive, without this step, every tree would probably use it for the top split, making all the trees look very similar.

### Prediction

*   **For Classification:** A new data point is passed down all the trees. The final prediction is the class that receives the **majority of votes** from the individual trees.
*   **For Regression:** The final prediction is the **average** of the predictions from all the trees.

## 4. Pros and Cons of Random Forest

### Pros:
*   **High Accuracy:** Generally provides high accuracy and is robust to outliers.
*   **Reduces Overfitting:** The combination of many decorrelated trees significantly reduces the variance and overfitting of single trees.
*   **Handles Missing Data:** Can maintain accuracy when a large proportion of the data is missing.
*   **Feature Importance:** Can provide estimates of feature importance.

### Cons:
*   **Less Interpretable:** It's a "black box" model. You lose the simple interpretability of a single decision tree.
*   **Slow Training:** Can be slow to train on very large datasets as it needs to build hundreds or thousands of trees.

*   **Interview Insight:** The key to Random Forest is that it builds a forest of **decorrelated** trees. Be ready to explain the two sources of randomness that achieve this: **bagging (row sampling with replacement)** and **feature randomness (column sampling at each split)**. Contrast its performance with a single decision tree, emphasizing the reduction in variance.
